# Unsupervised-Learning-model-of-Drosophila-olfaction
For the sake of studying and practicing some unsupervised learning techniques, I have tried to reproduce the results from the paper:
P. Arena, L. Patané and P. S. Termini, "An insect brain inspired neural model for object representation and expectation," The 2011 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, San Jose, CA, USA, 2011
I used Brian python library, which is very helpfull to code spiking neural networks.
